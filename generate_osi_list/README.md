# README

The code in [`generate.jl`](./generate.jl) generates the file `src/OSI_LICENSES.jl` by
parsing the SDPX 3.10 list of OSI approved licenses, which itself is available under a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (SPDX License ID CC-BY-3.0) license.

This code was run on Julia 1.6-rc1 (and so the Manifest is valid for that version of Julia).
